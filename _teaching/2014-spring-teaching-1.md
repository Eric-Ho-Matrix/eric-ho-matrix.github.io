Course Description
======

I was happy to be selected as HTA for Graduate Course ENGN 2912B Scientific programming in C++. This course was advised by Professor Daniel D. Moreno. During the class, we covered all of basic knowledge of C++. Started from basic data structures, we talked about the memory layout, pointers and moved to classes and String. After we were familiar with the basic concept, we talked about the vector, template coding, list, hash table and class inheritance. In the end, based on wxWidgets, the final task was to build a partical simulator that followed all real world physical laws.
