When people make decision, they tend to take many features into consideration. Many features may be obvious while some features may be "hidden". Suppose you are a new graduate student in Brown University, you need to rent a house or an apartment after you arrived in Providence. Different people have different requiements. One may consider whether this house is new, whether this community has a fitness center, or whether this community is pet friendly. These featrues are pretty obvious since you can have a quick observation of abovementnioned features or we can say STATES. However, while these state are obvious, some other states may not be obvious. Suppose you want to find a quiet community and you already have a target building, during the visit tour you find everything else are perfect except the community is very noisy because it near a street. Thus car noisy represents this community is noisy and then you may link this hidden state to the action of "Not rent this house". However, you may lack of some information. For example, there are so many cars in that day because the main road is damaged by the heavy rain and the police officers are instructing people drive a different way near the building. If you update this information, you may change your belief and link the "quiet" hidden state to the action of "Rent this house".

This decision-making process lead to an interesting question and is the main concern of scientists relates to cognitive science, computational neuroscience and reinforcement learning in computer science: When should we build a new state-action mapping and when should we update the current state-action mapping?

In this project, we proposed a biologically plausible cortico-basal ganglia (BG) model to address this question and we tested our model on a human behavior data. This project is conducted by the members in Learning Memory & Decision Lab in Brown University. More details and pictures are coming soon aftwe we submit the paper in 2 months.
