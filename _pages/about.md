Introduction
======
Hey! Nice to meet you and welcome to my website. My name is Qin(Eric) He, an untalenetd painter, a passionate basketball enthusiasts(Let's Gooo Celtics!!) and an engineer from Lanzhou, Gansu, NorthWest part of China [Check it out here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou) Currently, I'm a second year master student major in Electrical and Computer Engineering in Brown University. Before came to Brown, I spent four years in East China University of Science and Technology(ECUST) Shanghai, majoring in Automation and Control System.

**I'm applying for a PhD program starting from 2024 Fall**

Interests
======
My research interests are twofold. 
Currently my research interests in computational Neuroscience domain focus on **Basal Ganglia Learning, structure learning as well as reinforcement learning** and how learning and memory shape our decision-making process. Intelligent agents can automatically correct their actions based on new information and previous memory through feedback loop. My long term target is to revise computational model in human brain from control theory perspective. This work is almost done with Prof. Matt Nassar in [Learning and Memory and Decision Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/mattlab/). 

Secondly, vision as part of the most important perceptron components, I also interested in **multi-agents intelligent perceptron** and how vision helps robots navigation and localization. As traditional method through LK ray tracing and feature detection pipeline achieved great success in robots SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), some new methods like **NeRF** (Neural Radiance field) shows powerful application prospects. NeRF represents a real world scence in an implicit way, obstacles can be represented as density probability naturally. These featrues of NeRF can be well adapted to robotics application. Currently, I'm also working on a multi-agents SLAM project in [actlab](http://act.cs.brown.edu) with Prof. Nora Ayanian.

Before came to Brown, I spent 4 years on control system design, dynamics system analysis and optimization. In control part, I did an intern at Shanghai Robot Industrial Technology Institute mainly focus on semi-physical simulation verification and semi-physical program design based on Labview with Universal UR5 robot. In optimization part, I conducted a research focus on wind farm turbines yaw optimization under wake influence.
